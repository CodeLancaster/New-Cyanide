                            <p class="text">
                                <span class="textred"> Uzi Vert’s </span> come up isn’t the first of its kind in hip hop. Plenty of rappers before
                                him have made hit records, strengthened their fan base due to their internet popularity and
                                translated that to mainstream success, but the difference with Uzi is that he’s making music
                                unlike anything we’ve ever heard. A strange fusion of rap, R&B and hard rock medleys make
                                up Uzi’s unique sound and attitude towards creating music. At times, it’s somber and emphatic
                                and, most of the time, it's a puzzling mix of both. </p>

                            <p class="text">
                                <span class="textred"> Just </span>when you think you’ve started to figure out who Uzi is as not only artist but
                                person, the 2016 XXL Freshman flips the script and shows another side to his already multifaceted
                                personality. The lines don’t get any clearer to read on his new album, Luv Is Rage 2, as
                                the 23-year-old Philly native throws in more puzzle pieces to his unraveling story.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text">
                                <span class="textred"> To </span>the less trained mumble rap ear, Luv Is Rage 2 sounds similar to other Uzi projects
                                based simply on delivery. The melody and rhymes woven through thundering 808-driven beats
                                in a chillingly consistent way. But for those who’ve been rocking with Uzi since 2015’s first
                                installment of Luv Is Rage, this album puts that gravely mumble sound on songwriting steroids.
                                Instead on leaning innately on his staggering vocals to carry him through the majority of
                                his songs, these 16 tracks are structured much sturdier—a power move that will hopefully
                                turn those less trained ears into Uzi experts. </p>

                            <p class="text">
                                <span class="textred"> The </span> most obvious example of this other than the smash hit “XO Tour Llif3” is “The
                                Way Life Goes.” Touching yet again on his past relationship with ex-girlfriend Brittany Byrd,
                                Uzi sings with what appears to be a minimal amount of Auto-Tune and pours out his very candid
                                feelings about his relationship woes. Sad but matured Uzi sings, “I know it hurts sometimes
                                but you'll get over it/You'll find another life to live/I swear that you'll get over it,”
                                with near perfect vocals. His emotional battle with this obviously problematic relationship
                                fuels the majority of the lyrical content on this album. </p>
                            <p class="text">
                                <span class="textred"> At </span> one moment Uzi will pour his heart out for said female and then regret he ever
                                met her in the very next song. He wraps up his conundrum very simply on “X,” when he cries
                                out, “I could never stress/Yeah, my life's a mess/But I'm also blessed/My heart's in the
                                junkyard cause it's wrecked.”</p>
                            <p class="text">
                                <span class="textred"> These </span> type of pseudo-trap ballads are right within Uzi's wheelhouse and have been
                                for some time now—he’s actually strongest on this album when he freely experiments. “Neon
                                Guts” serves as the track with the most replay value on the LP and, of course, it features
                                fellow free-thinker Pharrell. The two go back and forth fluidly over a calming beat produced
                                by Pharrell himself. “Higher than Elon Musk, so high stars eat our dust/And I got a colorful
                                aura like I got neon guts/Dark energy, we don't touch, our jewelry be on Tut/And It give
                                a nigga colorful aura like I got neon guts” is delivered with such silky vocals from both
                                artists that it pretty much guarantees smash hit potential. Plus, Uzi manages to get off
                                some audible rap lines that would make even the harshest critics rethink labeling him a mumble
                                rapper.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text">
                                <span class="textred"> The </span> only real issue that faces Luv Is Rage 2 is its length. Sixteen songs is just
                                a little bit long for just about anyone to properly digest in 2017. Attention spans are short
                                and Uzi's expectations are high—had this album been capped off at a dozen songs, the replay
                                value might have rendered itself higher. Don’t get it twisted, Uzi has some great songs on
                                here that will undoubtedly get millions of plays but it’s hard to tell if people will be
                                talking about the album as a whole in six months’ time.</p>
                            <p class="text">
                                <span class="textred"> Despite </span> the long-winded nature of the album, Uzi definitely got it right with Luv
                                Is Rage 2. The songs are catchy, the beats are hot and Uzi gives a vocal performance that
                                redefines the term rap rock star. He still might be searching for his magnum opus album but
                                if he keeps putting out projects like this, and growing along the way, Uzi will find his
                                classic sooner rather than later. </p>
